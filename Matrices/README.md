# Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are commonly used in mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering to represent and manipulate a variety of mathematical objects, such as vectors, linear transformations, systems of equations, and graphs.

A matrix is defined by its size or dimensions, which are given by the number of rows and columns in the array. For example, a matrix with m rows and n columns is said to be an m x n matrix. The elements of a matrix are usually denoted by their position in the array using two subscripts, one for the row and one for the column.

Matrices can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and inverted, and these operations are fundamental to many areas of mathematics and science. They can also be used to solve systems of linear equations, compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and analyze the behavior of dynamical systems.

Matrices are often represented in computer programs using arrays or lists, and many programming languages have built-in functions and libraries for working with matrices. In addition, matrices can be visualized and manipulated using specialized software tools such as MATLAB, Mathematica, or Python's NumPy library.
