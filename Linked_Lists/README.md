# Linked Lists
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike an array, the elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node points to the next node, forming a chain-like structure.

A linked list can be used to implement various data structures such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. There are two main types of linked lists: singly-linked lists and doubly-linked lists. In a singly-linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node, while in a doubly-linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes.

Linked lists have several advantages over arrays, including the ability to efficiently insert or delete elements from the list, even in the middle of the list, without requiring the entire list to be rearranged. However, linked lists also have some disadvantages, such as requiring more memory overhead than arrays, and not providing constant-time random access to elements.
