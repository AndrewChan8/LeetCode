# Trees
In computer science, a tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges or branches. A tree has a single node, called the root, which serves as the starting point of the tree, and every other node in the tree is connected to it by a unique path.

Each node in a tree may have one or more child nodes, which are connected to it by edges or branches. A node with no children is called a leaf node or a terminal node, while a node with one or more children is called an internal node or a non-terminal node.

Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships between objects or entities, such as file systems, organization charts, family trees, and game trees. They can also be used to implement various algorithms and data structures, such as search trees, heap trees, and decision trees.

Trees have many useful properties, such as efficient searching and sorting algorithms, and the ability to represent complex relationships and structures in a simple and intuitive way. They are also used in many programming languages and software tools, and are an important concept in computer science and information technology.
