# String
In programming, a string is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. A character can be any letter, digit, symbol, or whitespace, and a string can consist of one or more of these characters.

Strings are usually enclosed in quotation marks, such as single quotes ('hello') or double quotes ("world"). Some programming languages also support triple quotes ("""hello world""") for strings that span multiple lines.

Strings are widely used in programming for various purposes, such as storing text data, formatting output, and representing data in a structured way. They can be manipulated using various string functions or methods, such as concatenation, slicing, and searching.
