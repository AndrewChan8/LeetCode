# Arrays
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. The elements in an array are accessed using an index, which is an integer value that specifies the position of the element within the array.

Arrays are commonly used in programming because they provide a convenient way to store and manipulate data. They are used to store collections of values such as numbers, characters, or objects, and can be used to represent a variety of data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, and matrices.

In most programming languages, arrays have a fixed size, which is determined when the array is created. The size of an array is usually specified using a constant or a variable, and it cannot be changed during the lifetime of the array.

Arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or multi-dimensional, depending on the number of indices needed to access the elements of the array. One-dimensional arrays are often referred to as vectors, while two-dimensional arrays are commonly used to represent matrices.
